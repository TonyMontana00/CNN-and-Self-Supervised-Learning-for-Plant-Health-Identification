# CNN and Self-Supervised Learning for Plant Health Identification
 
## Overview

This project aims to develop a system for identifying plant health using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Self-Supervised Learning techniques. The goal is to accurately classify plant health status based on images, which can help in early detection of diseases and improve crop management.

## Features

- **CNN Architecture**: Utilizes a deep learning model to extract features from plant images.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Implements self-supervised learning to improve model performance with limited labeled data.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies various data augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TonyMontana00/CNN-and-Self-Supervised-Learning-for-Plant-Health-Identification.git
    ```
